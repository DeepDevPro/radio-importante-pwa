Deploy #10: RADICAL CLEANUP - Removed all conflicting .ebextensions configs

- Cleaned up multiple conflicting configuration files
- Fixed empty Procfile that was 0 bytes  
- Created single clean .ebextensions/01-app-config.config
- Removed debug scripts that could interfere with deployment
- This should eliminate "Engine execution has encountered an error"
